# Deep-Learning-
Image recognition. In this project, I used a CIFAR100 dataset https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html to build and train a neural network to perform image recognision. The network I built was a Convolutional Neural Network which I fine tuned with regularisers, batchnorm, convolution and pooling layers augmentation to make it better at classifing the images.
