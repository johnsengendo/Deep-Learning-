# Deep-Learning image classification.
Image recognisition and classification has become a leading application for deeplearning which has found applications in health for cancer diagnosis, self driving cars , car number plate reading in self operated parkings. Applications of Deep learning are still growing exponentially. 
In this project, I and my fellow colleagues performed an Image recognisition task on a CIFAR100 dataset https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html 

The task involved building and training a neural network to perform image recognision. The network built was a Convolutional Neural Network which was fine tuned with hyper parameters regularisers, batchnorm, convolution and pooling layers augmentation to make it better at classifing the images.

In this repository, I attach a full python script that accurately performed the classification task with an accuracy of over 97% measured using a confussin matrix.

### Requirements:
Runing on colab with a GPU enabled
