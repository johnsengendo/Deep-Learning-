# Deep-Learning-
Image recognisition and classification has become a leading application for deeplearning which has found applications in health for  cancer diagnosis, self driving cars In this project, car number plate reading in self operated parkings. Applications of Deep learning are still growing exponentially. 
In this project, I and my fellow colleagues performed an Image recognisition task on a CIFAR100 dataset https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html 
The task involved building and training a neural network to perform image recognision. The network  built was a Convolutional Neural Network which wss fine tuned with regularisers, batchnorm, convolution and pooling layers augmentation to make it better at classifing the images.
